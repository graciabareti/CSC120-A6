- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I felt like it made the most sense and was the most direct aspect of java that has been taught thus far as referring to family dynamics of parents and uncles and aunts helped to better understand
the concept of inheritance. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel like working with a partner on this assignment made this assignment a lot better to
understand as it helped talking it through with another peer.
